    <h1>Week #1</h1>
    <h2>Reading Summary</h2>
    The three articles assigned this week all explored the role technology plays in our society and how it is impacting my life. In “Where Deer Stroll Peacefully Past Computers,” author Logic Mag highlights how our lives are gradually being controlled by technologies and major technology companies such as Facebook, Amazon, and more. Before we realize it, our lives are inseparable from these technologies, and the pandemic is a timely event that serves as an example of how technologies couldn't solve all of our problems. When we become too engagef with technology, our own individual, unique identities start fading. In "The Poetry of Tools," author Mindy Seu gives various example of computer languages and how they interact with humans and the digital space. It is interesting to see how language, something that we created, plays a role in the digital space and leave impact beyond. Overall I really enjoyed the articles assigned this week, they made me rethink how technologies have played a major role in my life and reposition myself in the society today.

    <h1>Week #2</h1>
    <h2>Reading Summary</h2>
    The articles assigned this week focused on digital care. As the world of technology advances, our lives become inseparatble from our phones, tablets, and laptops. Cyborg mother's work is very interesting in that she does a great job of mixing technology with various aspects of our lives, such as relationships, social spaces and the economy. Through her art, we're able to witness the power and effect of technology from an outsider's standpoint, as opposed to we who're involved. Her piece, "Dream System," is a sci-fi game that prompts particpants to dream about the future and imagine a future that is outside an AI's imagination. Users are able to create characters, settings, and scenes and prototype interactions between them. In a world controlled by technology, it is an entertaining take for us to be the gods, the controllers of the world while we are able to manipulate any aspect of it.

    <h2>Reading Summary</h2>
    The three articles assigned this week explored the concept of cyberfeminism, and I find the concept intriguing. As a female user of the internet and an interactor with the digital space, I've never realized how different each individual cybernetic experience can potentially be. I spent a lot of time on the cyberfeminism index website by Mindy Seu, because it has such a diverse collection of writing, images, and thoughts regarding the topic. After reading through them, I found that Seu's definition and interpretation of cyberfeminism is very different from what I initially thought. It is more colorful and fun to look at, for she documents many details of the cyberfeminism space. It makes me realize how easily it is for us to oversee the impact females have that shaped the current and past internet.

    <h2>Discussion Questions</h2>
    - What is your opinion on Mindy Seu's definition of cyberfeminism? 
    <br>
    - To you, what does cyberfeminism mean?
    <br>
    - How does each country and culture shaped cyberfeminism? Do you think cyberfeminism is similar or different in each country/culture?

    <h1>Week #4</h1>
    <h2>Reading Summary</h2>
    The three articles assigned this week explored the concept of consent tech, and I find the concept intriguing. As a frequent user of the internet, I am aware that the web is constantly tracking my data. For example, I often find advertisements on the side of my web browser screens after I searched that exact object up. While this could be convenient sometimes, it feels more creepy and uncomfortable to me. I enjoyed exploring the New Organs website, where the page is filled with ears that turned out to be content on the web secretly listening and watching us. At the end of each small video, it asks the question "How did it know?" Indeed, we never gave consent to these browsers and webpages, yet, they're analyzing our searches, actions, and beyond and trying to predict our next move and desire. No matter how accurate their predictions are, this act should be forbidden, for it is attempting to limit our imagination of what we want to do with the web. I strongly believe there should be stricter regulations regarding consentful technology. Though this is hardly possible,  I wish the online space could be a utopia rather than a distopia.
    <br>
    <h2>Discussion Questions</h2>
    - What is your experience with consentful tech? 
    <br>
    - Would you give consent to your technology? If so, to what extent?
    <br>
    - Do you think we can live completely without tech consent? If not, how much is a reasonable trade-off?

    <h1>Week #6</h1>
    <h2>Reading Summary</h2>
    The articles assigned this week explored the concept of indigenous and post-colonial computing, and I find the concept intriguing. Though I am familiar with both of these words in a traditional historical context, it is amazing to see how they are integrated into the digital culture. I think the usage of the word "indigenous" is interesting. because it has multiple definitions and could be interpreted in various ways. According to the archive "What are the characteristics that are distinct to Indigenous technology?," indigenous technology is lively and natural. I find this argument controversial, for to my opinion, every technology is, on some degree, artificial because it is technology. Therefore, how does one differentiate between indigenous technology and non-indigenous technology, if they have the same base? Upon reading some more, I realized that it is indeed hard to draw the line between indigenous and non-indigenous technology, for non-indigenous technology could always facilitate a degree of organic. With the growth of technology, we're already experiencing realistic experiences such as immersive cinema and mixed reality. It wouldn't be surprise to me if one day, the line between indigenous and non-indigenous technology is blurred and the two are merged together. 
    <br>
    <h2>Discussion Questions</h2>
    - What is your interpretation of the word 'indigenous technology'? What does the phrase mean to you as a whole and broken up? 
    <br>
    - Do you think you can differentiate between indigenous and non-indigenous technology? If yes, through what ways? If not, why?
    <br>
    - Identify a piece of indigenous technology around you, and trace its ancestry.

    <h1>Week #10</h1>
    <h2>Reading Summary</h2>
    NFT is definitely a topic that I've heard of several times yet still haven't had the chance to explore and learn more about. To me, the definition of NFT is confusing, because I couldn't get over the idea how does one own a piece of digital 'item' on the internet if I can just download, copy-paste, or screenshot the image or audio? And if I only use that piece for my own and never show it to public, the rightful owner might never find out about this. In the present, the usage of internet is so widespread that we often care less about the original owner of a picture we use in a middle school powerpoint or a gif for a club event. Without the physical interaction, digital ownership seems to be pretty powerless. If I see a person owning an oil painting in real life, the most I can do is admire its beauty and perhaps take an image if the owner allows. However, if I see the same painting online, the text of the owner's name is far less persuasive than a real human-being and a simple drag and drop of the painting image probably has a better quality than my phone camera.

    <h2>Discussion Questions</h2>
    - What is your opinion of digital ownership? 
    <br>
    - To your pinion, what is the point of having NFTs?
    <br>
    - Do you think NFTs are worth it? Would you like to own one?

    <h2>Reading Summary</h2>
    The Google project I really enjoyed is Teachable Machine. It is designed and developed to give everyone, even people who doesn't know how to code, a chance to try out machine learning and get a taste of the technology. It is amazing to see how easy and intuitive it is to use and make audiences feel accomplished when they train their own model to recognize something that is personal to them. The project that I enjoyed from the human (un)limited exhibition is Hyundai Motorstudio Beijing, where artists from across the world come together to build under one topic: exploring how culture and technology can learn from each other. I think this is a fascinating topic considering this week's theme is machine learning. A particular piece i found interesting is !brute_force by Maja Smrekar. She poses the question of how machines can learn from animals like dogs. To Smrekar's premise, modern machines learn from our surrounding in order to pick up patterns to entertain and fulfill us, which is an intriging thought because it made me rethink our relationship with our environment.

    <h2>Discussion Questions</h2>
    - Which area of machine learning are you interested in the most? 
    <br>
    - To your pinion, do you think a day will come when there is no way to differentiate between human and machine learning?
